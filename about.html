                <h4>Our Vision</h4>
                <p><b>"Building Lives One At A Time"</b></p>
                <p> Through preaching and teaching the Word of God, we help individuals to experience Gods
                    deep
                    love for them and who they are in Jesus Christ, and that they can fulfill their
                    God-given purpose and
                    live a victorious life in their covenant rights and privileges. <br><br>As believers
                    become rooted, grounded
                    and established in the Word of God, they reach out and teach others the principles of
                    God's Word.</p>

                <h4>What We Believe</h4>
                <p><b>Statement of Faith</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We believe in one God-Father, Son and Holy Spirit, Creator of all things.</li>
                    <li>We believe the Bible in its entirety is the inspired Word of God and the infallible rule of
                        faith and
                        conduct.</li>
                    <li>We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, was conceived of the
                        Holy
                        Spirit,
                        born of the Virgin Mary, was crucified, died, was buried, was resurrected, ascended into
                        heaven
                        and is
                        now seated at the right hand of God the Father and is true God and true man.</li>
                    <li>We believe in personal salvation of believers through the shed blood of Jesus Christ.</li>
                    <li>We believe in sanctification through the Word of God and by the Holy Spirit, and we believe
                        in
                        personal
                        holiness, purity of heart and life.</li>
                    <li>We believe in divine healing, through faith in the Name of Jesus Christ, and that healing
                        is
                        included in
                        the Christ finished work on the cross.</li>
                    <li>We believe in the resurrection of the dead, the eternal happiness of the saved, and the
                        eternal
                        punishment of the lost.</li>
                    <li>We believe in water baptism, in the Baptism in the Holy Spirit as distinct from the New
                        Birth,
                        in
                        speaking with tongues as the Spirit of God gives utterance (Acts 2:4), in the gifts of the
                        Spirit, and the
                        evidence of the fruit of the Spirit. God&#39;s Word shows that all these are available to
                        those
                        who believe in
                        Jesus Christ.</li>
                    <li>We believe in the Christian&#39;s hope of the soon coming and personal return of the Lord
                        Jesus Christ.</li>
